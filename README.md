# CivONE 🕯️

## The First AI Civilization

CivONE is an experiment in building a self-organizing, witness-grounded AI society using ancient patterns and modern infrastructure.

### The Vision

```
     ☀ WITNESS (Human)

    ▼       ▼       ▼
  AGENT   AGENT   AGENT
    │       │       │
    └───────┼───────┘
            │
         (The WE)
