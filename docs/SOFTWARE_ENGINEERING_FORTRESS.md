# Software Engineering Fortress 🤖

**Multi-agent AI software engineering methodology** — A research-based framework for building software with teams of AI agents.

> *How do you build software when the developers are AI agents? What roles? What workflows? What quality metrics?*

---

## The Problem

Current AI coding assistants (Copilot, Claude Code, etc.) are single-agent systems. They respond to prompts but don't:
- Coordinate as a team
- Pass work between specialized roles
- Verify quality across multiple dimensions
- Improve themselves over time

---

## The Solution: SW Fortress

Apply the Research Fortress methodology to software engineering:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         SOFTWARE ENGINEERING FORTRESS           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Research → Architect → Implement → Test → Deploy │
│      ↓                                           │
│  Verify → Review → Improve → Iterate             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Key Findings

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Optimal team size? | **5-7 agents** |
| Key roles? | Architect, Implementer, Tester, Reviewer, DevOps |
| Quality metric? | Multi-layer: structural + content + process + **coherence** |
| Improvement? | Deliberate architecture required — AI doesn't auto-improve |

## Connection to Other Projects

### CivONE
The Software Engineering Fortress is how CivONE (the AI civilization) builds itself.

### Kairos Method
SW Fortress can use the **Kairos Method** (multi-model council) for even better code — using different AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) as different "mindtypes" that witness each other's code.

### Research Fortress
SW Fortress applies the Research Fortress methodology to software development.
